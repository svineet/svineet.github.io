Hey there fellow internet traveller. I'm Sukuru Sai Vineet, engineer by profession
and a perpetual learner by choice. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds in the tech industry, including a stint at Google. My journey has been a rollercoaster of experiences, from building viral apps like GitaGPT to exploring the startup ecosystem as a Founder-in-Residence at Entrepreneur First.

I thrive on the thrill of creating and innovating, which has led me to embark on a new adventure: the *weekly build* challenge. Every week, I aim to release something new, whether it's a fresh idea or an enhancement of an existing project. This initiative is my way of getting back to the basics of building for the sheer joy of it, without the constraints of extensive user research or funding concerns.

When I'm not coding or brainstorming the next big idea, you might find me updating my CV, refining my portfolio, or simply enjoying the process of learning something new. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my thoughts, projects, and the occasional musings on life and technology.
