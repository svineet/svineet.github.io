Hey there fellow internet traveller. I'm Sukuru Sai Vineet, an engineer by profession from India.

More about my professional life in [my CV](/static/CV.pdf)

I like startups, AI, motorcycles, travelling, coffee, reading (a lot), and making cool things.
A bit of psychology sometimes too, the Jungian kind.

You can email me at [saivineet89@gmail.com](mailto:saivineet89@gmail.com), or send me a tweet (Xeet?) at [@SaiVineet2](https://twitter.com/SaiVineet2)
Always up to chat with cool people!
