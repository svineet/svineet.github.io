We live in the most interesting and important time in human history. We are now thousands of days away from AGI.

Humanoid robots (Figure, 1x, Tesla), nuclear fusion (Helion), medical advancements. It will either be superabundance, or
complete death of society soon enough. To be seen! But let's assume the world will work out, and we have a hyper abundant
civilisation.

What then? What are the next frontiers?

Space travel, colonising the solar system, then other solar systems, then other galaxies, and so on. That's
what the plan and the progress look like.

But I think there might be a deeper mystery that unlocks a whole new tech tree. Something that will change
the scientific method (our best method of discerning truth) itself. Space is outside, but consciousness is... inside?

## Superintelligence is coming

It's pretty clear by now that intelligence will become a commodity, and once superintelligence is here, products and services will become hyper abundant (or end of civilisation, classic AI goes rogue stuff or something, not much can be done by me here).
Once we live in a hyper abundant civilisation (humanoid robots, chips that can now reason and have actual superhuman intelligence, fusion and fission for energy abundance, bio is solved using evolved versions of AlphaFold etc, extended lifetimes, so many cool things to look forward to), we then think what's the next frontier. One is quite obvious: space.

DeepSeek. RL. AGI is thousands of days away.

There are quite a few ways this can play out, and there will be a transition flux between the information
age and the intelligence age. I do not know how exactly this plays out, and it is quite hard to predict how
economics, politics and social policy evolves here. Everything is about to change, and change at this sort of
pace is quite unnerving and anxiety inducing.

So instead of debating how to make it through the transition
well, I want to bring to light what the next frontier can be after the intelligence age is in full swing.

Space is an obvious one, and humanity is making rapid strides towards it with reusable rockets and a huge
amount of talent working towards space technology via startups.

But there is another field that we do not understand: the nature of consciousness, and what can be done with it
once we understand the underlying dynamics of it.

## Next frontier: there is something beyond space. Not outside, inside.

## Re-inventing Science itself

Observer and observed

## a consciousness research laboratory

## current state of research: Conscious Agents
Jung
Space-time-psyche?
Idealism: mind creates reality?

Perception: a filter, or a transformation? There is an outer world.

## Scripture: strange hints (pretty much guides!) from ancients

Ashtavakra Gita. Yog Vashist.

## CIA's consciousness research, and the Munroe institute

## Do we truly see the real world?

Hoffman's conscious agents. Qualia Research Institute.

## What doors does a science of consciousness research open?


I think there's another. I think consciousness research as a field will evolve, and we might be able to make artificial consciousness. Think of OpenAI, but for consciousness research, focussed on inventing a science of consciousness. Huge things are already happening in that area of research, it's basically a merger of three fields: neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. 

I think there is a good chance we live in space-time-consciousness, and the "psyche" is a fundamental force/entity in the universe. A lot of interesting things go into this research, and it also involves "spirituality" (not the insta kind, the actual stuff like Yog Vashist and Ashtavakra Gita and Buddha's teachings which investigate the nature of consciousness, or provide techniques to do so). Science as it exists presumes a duality: observer and observed. It might just not be true, and that requires a re-invention of the scientific method itself. I think there's a strong chance consciousness generates this field of reality we call matter and space-time, which is another mindfuck trip by itself.

So that's the ambition. A research lab oriented towards inventing a science of consciousness. What can be made possible once we have that? Teleportation. Remote viewing and perception. Consciousness transfer across bodies and matter. Reprogramming reality live. Messing with time itself. This seems as strange and distant and weird to us, as "black slabs that allow people to talk across continents" sounded to a person in 1900.
