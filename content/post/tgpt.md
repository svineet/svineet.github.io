Welcome to the first weekly build! This is a part of a series of posts, a new year activity I'm upto of building and releasing (or improving) something every week.

You can see the rest of the posts in the [weekly build](/tags/weekly-build/) series.

## the idea

I've become too used to ChatGPT.

Every time I open my GNOME Terminal, I am disappointed. I want to write a natural language instruction. I want the thing to write bash itself and execute the steps. Maybe even pull from the web. Sometimes, I just want to talk ChatGPT, and not have to copy commands in. I just want to type out "Move the docker image location from /root to /home", and instead of yapping and back-and-forth conversation, give me the command and ask me if I want to execute it.

So to solve this personal pet peeve of mine, I decided to make `tgpt`, a simple python-based command line utility, that starts a chat and outputs bash commands that you can accept or reject.

## `tgpt`: demo and usage

## how to get it
pipx? pip install? install from source?

## implementation

## future plans
