I have been accepted into [Google Summer of Code 2020 with GNOME Foundation][1]!

I am grateful to my mentor albfan and the whole GNOME developer community to have helped
me become capable enough to tackle this project. Can't wait to get my hands dirty
and become a strong member of the GNOME community!
