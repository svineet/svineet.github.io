It was quite a thrilling experience, I made good friends, tried out many co-founder pairings, had a good idea that I tried to get customers for as well.\nEntrepreneur First has quite the interesting model. They collect highly talented individuals in a cohort, and then encourage them to get paired into optimal teams. The expected result of the three-four month sprint is to end up with a venture funding worthy business idea, that has early traction with the two co-founders being the right people to build the startup. My cohort saw quite the interesting bunch of startups, from space tech (shoutout to Aule Space), to developer tools (shoutout vluna) and AI agent startups from a general AI agent company, to one verticalised on Salesforce administration.\nMeeting the cohort was an absolute blessing, and I am quite grateful that I met these wonderful ambitious smart folks, who I can build so much with. I grew a lot as a person during the last 6 months.\nGot an idea about re-inventing code search and understanding in the developer tools domain, then did a lot of user research to validate it, got it validated as well. My idea was quite simple: understanding and navigating codebases from simple stuff like just classes, to larger questions like ‚ÄúWhy does this microservice use Firebase for authentication and not the in house authentication module, and when was this decision made?‚Äù , all answered by a simple chatbot that is trained on your company‚Äôs codebase, technical documentation, issue tracker and the QnA channels within the company.\nHowever, on attempting to get design partners, things did not go well. It was hard to establish trust as a 25 year old, to give me the whole codebase and all engineering lifecycle data, and honestly the problem wasn‚Äôt that burning enough that people would want a separate tool. Then GitHub too released documentation and issues as data sources for Copilot Chat, and that basically stopped my startup in the tracks.\nI loved it though, and it was quite fun and exciting being a founder. I learnt a lot about how to conduct user interviews, how to interface with people, the process of customer acquisition, and most importantly how damn hard being a founder is, mentally and physically.\nWhat‚Äôs next then? Somewhere, I felt that I have been too deliberate about trying to validate ideas and get things going that way. It did not feel natural to me. In fact, the last time a project of mine succeeded (GitaGPT), was just a fun thing I built and released within a day.\nAfter all, I do get a huge kick out of just building things, and since Cursor has accelerated my development cycle so much, it might just be faster to make things and show the world, get a tight iteration loop right there. So now the plan is simple. I will make things, and release them.\ngetting back to basics: the builder way üõ†Ô∏è No playbooks, no ‚Äúwill it get funded?‚Äù thinking, no extensive user research, just pure building the things I want to see in the world. High failure is expected, downside is non-existent.\nSo as a new year resolution, here‚Äôs a thing I‚Äôm going to do. I‚Äôm calling it, weekly build.\nweekly build: making something every week üìÖ Every Saturday, I will release something I‚Äôve been building over the past week. It might be something new, or a major upgrade of something already being built. The idea is to monetise right away as well, to test out whether it is actually a viable business idea.\nthe first build is quite simple, and has been personally quite useful to me\nterminal agent üíª Every time I open my GNOME Terminal, I am disappointed. I want to write a natural language instruction. I want the thing to write bash itself and execute the steps. Maybe even pull from the web.

I just want to type out ‚ÄúMove the docker image location from /root to /home‚Äù, and instead of yapping and back-and-forth conversation, give me the command and ask me if I want to execute it.\nSo I made an agent that lives inside the terminal, invoked by tgpt.\nHere is the full post about it, including idea, implementation and other details.\n","wordCount":"817","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"svineet"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://svineet.com/post/2025-01-03-new-year/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"svineet.log","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://svineet.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://svineet.com/ accesskey=h title="svineet.log (Alt + H)"><img src=https://svineet.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>svineet.log</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://svineet.com/post title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://svineet.com/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://svineet.com/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://svineet.com/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">new beginnings, old endings, and a happy new year</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 3, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;817 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;svineet</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#trying-to-startup->trying to startup üöÄ</a></li><li><a href=#getting-back-to-basics-the-builder-way->getting back to basics: the builder way üõ†Ô∏è</a></li><li><a href=#weekly-build-making-something-every-week->weekly build: making something every week üìÖ</a></li><li><a href=#terminal-agent->terminal agent üíª</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>It&rsquo;s been quite a long while since I updated my personal website.
