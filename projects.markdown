A list of the *public* projects I've produced over my coding career.  
They are mostly from my early days (2013-2017), since I started working on proprietary
technology more after I came to college.

### Dumb Markov Model

[Repository](https://github.com/svineet/DumbMarkovModel)

This little program trains a markov chain of 2-grams over the brown corpus,
and then generates random sentences using DFS over the markov chain.

### Physics: a physics simulator

[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v1vjaEtMNI)  
[Repository](https://github.com/svineet/physics)

A small playpen where whatever you draw comes to life. I made this for the Kivy app contest back
in 2014, in about 7 days of continous inspiration. It can only be understood by looking at the video
so try it out!

### ebyte judge

[Repository](https://github.com/svineet/ebyte-judge)

A codechef like online judge, where you can put in your program and it gets tested against
test cases that have been written down before. I made this for my school. It also showed
analytics on what other teams are upto, upping the tension of the competition.
