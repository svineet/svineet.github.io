Hey guys. It's been quite a while, I last added my first GSoC post on this blog.

Life has moved on, and I have been busy too. Follow my socials for that (Insta: svineet_).

But yes, now I've moved the website to a DigitalOcean droplet, hosted on nginx and compiled  
static using Jekyll. That's it. Probably will make a new email address soon.

Hmm maybe something like me@svineet.com ? heheh
