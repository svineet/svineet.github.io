Terminal dwellers often find a lack of good software for the college atmosphere. One of
those gaps is the DC network, a local P2P torrenting network used in colleges.

Here is a cool terminal based DC client I found: [ncdc](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc)

It is available in Fedora repositories as `ncdc`. It must be available on Ubuntu repositories as well, probably
with the same name.
```bash
sudo dnf install ncdc -y
```
